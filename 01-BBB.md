# Easy questions

## Sum of numbers

Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of 17, return **true** since 10 + 7 is 17.

## Url shortner

Implement a URL shortener with the following methods:

- `shorten(url)`, which shortens the url into a six-character alphanumeric string, such as `zLg6wl`.
- `restore(short)`, which expands the shortened string into the original url. If no such shortened string exists, return `null`.

Hint: What if we enter the same URL twice?

### Discussion

First let's compute how many url can we short this way.
With figures like 'A..Za..z0..9', let's remove {i, I, l, L, o, O, 0, 1}, because is easy to miread them, we can have 56 figures

```python
cifer = 'abcdefghjklmnpqrstuvxywzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVXYWZ23456789'

def tocode(n):
    ret  = ''
    for i in range(6):
        ret = cifer[n%len(cifer)] + ret
        n //= len(cifer)
    return ret


tocode(0)
# 'aaaaaa'

tocode(56**6-1)
# '999999'

```

So we can have 56<sup>6</sup> codes. 30_840_979_456 a little bit less than 31 billions.

Multiplying this by a resonable average of url lenght (64 bytes), we need to store 1_973_822_685_184 => 2 Petabytes of urls. We can't do this in memory so let's store it on an S3 like storage, our file will be called like the sorten version.

We must compute an hash of the url, distributed 0..30_840_979_455 and store the url in a file with name computed with the `tocode` function.

When we save the url, We check if the file is there. If not, we erite it. DONE
  If we find already a file, we check the content. If it is equel, we are DONE
    If the content is differente we compute the next hash, with an evolving function. next = (hash + 4_405_854_209) % 30_840_979_456  (4_405_854_208 is a 7th of 30_840_979_456 )

Is very unprobable that we go back to the starting hash, but if this happen it means we run out of free space. We'll need 7 figures not 6. We are not taking this scenario in account.

```python
def my_hash(s):
    b = s.encode('utf-8')
    ret = 0
    for x in range(len(b)//8):
        ret <<= 4
        ret += struct.unpack('<Q', b[:8])[0]
        ret %= 30_840_979_456
        b = b[8:]
    ret <<= 4
    ret += struct.unpack('<Q', b + b'\x00' * (8-len(b)))[0]
    ret %= 30_840_979_456
    return ret

my_hash('https://www.google.com')
# 380_781_788

my_hash('https://www.google.com/?q=search')
# 19_750_499_088

```

We can also use MD5 or SHA256 from the core libraries of a lot of languages, just remeber to `% 30_840_979_456` the output

## 47

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

### Solution
Find the `min` and then the `max` after that min.

```python

def gain(stocks):
    _ptmin = _min = None
    for idx, stock in enumerate(stocks):
        if _min is None or stock < _min:
            _min = stock
            _ptmin = idx
    _max = max(stocks[_ptmin:])
    return _max-_min

```

## 63 Kids Game

Given a 2D matrix of characters and a target word, write a function that returns whether the word can be found in the matrix by going left-to-right, or up-to-down.
For example, given the following matrix:
```
[['F', 'A', 'C', 'I'],
 ['O', 'B', 'Q', 'P'],
 ['A', 'N', 'O', 'B'],
 ['M', 'A', 'S', 'S']]
```
and the target word 'FOAM', you should return true, since it's the leftmost column. Similarly, given the target word 'MASS', you should return true, since it's the last row.


### Solution
```python
def check(matrix, word):
    # left to right
    if word in [''.join(x) for x in matrix]:
        return True
    if word in [''.join(x[::-1]) for x in zip(*matrix[::-1])]:
        return True
    return False
```

`zip(*matrix[::-1])` is used to rotate the matrix

## 65 Spiral Print

Given a N by M matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral.
For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
```

You should print out the following:

```
1
2
3
4
5
10
15
20
19
18
17
16
11
6
7
8
9
14
13
12
```

```python

while matrix:
    for x in matrix[0]:
        print(x)
    matrix = matrix[1:]
    if matrix:
        matrix = [x[::-1] for x in zip(*matrix[::-1])][::-1]

```

Print first row, rotate and go on, until run out of matrix

## 69 Product of numbers

Given a list of integers, return the largest product that can be made by multiplying any three integers.
For example, if the list is [-10, -10, 5, 2], we should return 500, since that's -10 * -10 * 5.
You can assume the list has at least three integers.

## Product of numbers

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`. There are never zeros in the input array.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.

*Follow-up: what if you can't use division?*

### first solution

For first we compute the product of all the elements of the array.

```python
product = 1
for x in input_list:
    product *= x
```

now we create a new array with element the product divided by the element in the same position in the input_list

```python
result_list = [product / float(x) for x in input_list]
```

this works because of the properties of multiplicaion and divisions

#### note on python3

We could use `reduce` for the product of all the elements of an array in this way:

```python
product = reduce(lambda prev, curr: prev*curr, input_list, 1)
```

But in python3 `reduce` is no more a primitive statement, but you need to import it from the `functools` module, because the guide line is that a `for` loop is more readable.

### without the division.

if you cheat from the mathematically point of view you can do

```python
result_list = [product * (x**-1) for x in input_list]
```

but probably this is not what the interviewer wants.

We can compute 2 lists, one with the product from the start of the list upto the current element, and another in the same way, but reversing the input_list before. So after this we do:

```python
p = 1
prod_array = []
for x in input_list:
    prod_array.append(p)
    p *= x

p = 1
prod_reverse_array = []
for x in input_list[::-1]:
    prod_reverse_array.append(p)
    p *= x
```

and we get

```python
prod_array == [1, 1, 2, 6, 24]
prod_reverse_array[::-1] == [120, 60, 20, 5, 1]
```

if we zip together the 2 lists multipling, we get

```python
result = [x*y for x,y in zip(prod_array, prod_reverse_array[::-1])]
```

#### all the code together

```python
def solution(input_list):
    p = 1
    prod_array = []
    for x in input_list:
        prod_array.append(p)
        p *= x

    p = 1
    prod_reverse_array = []
    for x in input_list[::-1]:
        prod_reverse_array.append(p)
        p *= x

    result = [x*y for x,y in zip(prod_array, prod_reverse_array[::-1])]
    return result
```

## Operation tree

Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a binary tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
Given the root to such a tree, write a function to evaluate it.
For example, given the following tree:

```
    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
```

You should return 45, as it is `(3 + 2) * (4 + 5)`.

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse it in-place.

```python
def reverse(node, prev_node = None):
    if node:
        next_node = node.next
        node.next = prec_node
        reverse(next_node, node)
```

A number is considered perfect if its digits sum up to exactly 10.
Given a positive integer n, return the n-th perfect number.
For example, given 1, you should return 19. Given 2, you should return 28.

## 72 hard

This problem was asked by Google.
In a directed graph, each node is assigned an uppercase letter. We define a path's value as the number of most frequently-occurring letter along that path. For example, if a path in the graph goes through "ABACA", the value of the path is 3, since there are 3 occurrences of 'A' on the path.
Given a graph with n nodes and m directed edges, return the largest value path of the graph. If the largest value is infinite, then return null.
The graph is represented with a string and an edge list. The i-th character represents the uppercase letter of the i-th node. Each tuple in the edge list (i, j) means there is a directed edge from the i-th node to the j-th node. Self-edges are possible, as well as multi-edges.
For example, the following input graph:
ABACA
[(0, 1),
 (0, 2),
 (2, 3),
 (3, 4)]
Would have maximum value 3 using the path of vertices [0, 2, 3, 4], (A, A, C, A).
The following input graph:
A
[(0, 0)]
Should return null, since we have an infinite loop.

This problem was asked by Amazon.
Given a string, find the longest palindromic contiguous substring. If there are more than one with the maximum length, return any one.
For example, the longest palindromic substring of "aabcdcb" is "bcdcb". The longest palindromic substring of "bananas" is "anana".

```python
def fx(s):
    start=0
    l=2
    ret=""
    while start+l<=len(s):
        rev = s[start+l-1:start-1:-1]
        if start==0:
            rev = s[l-1::-1]
        if s[start:start+l] == rev and l>len(ret):
            ret = s[start:start+l]
        l += 1
        if start+l>len(s):
            start+=1
            l=2
    return ret
```

##  44

This problem was asked by Google.

We can determine how "out of order" an array A is by counting the number of inversions it has. Two elements A[i] and A[j] form an inversion if A[i] > A[j] but i < j. That is, a smaller element appears after a larger element.

Given an array, count the number of inversions it has. Do this faster than O(N^2) time.

You may assume each element in the array is distinct.

For example, a sorted list has zero inversions. The array [2, 4, 1, 3, 5] has three inversions: (2, 1), (4, 1), and (4, 3). The array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] has ten inversions: every distinct pair forms an inversion.

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

* `push(val)`, which pushes an element onto the stack
* `pop()`, which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return `null`.
* `max()`, which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Each method should run in constant time.

## 42 hard?

This problem was asked by Google.
Given a list of integers S and a target number k, write a function that returns a subset of S that adds up to k. If such a subset cannot be made, then return null.

Integers can appear more than once in the list. You may assume all numbers in the list are positive.

For example, given S = [12, 1, 61, 5, 9, 2] and k = 24, return [12, 9, 2, 1] since it sums up to 24.

Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary.
For example, given the list of flights [('SFO', 'HKO'), ('YYZ', 'SFO'), ('YUL', 'YYZ'), ('HKO', 'ORD')] and starting airport 'YUL', you should return the list ['YUL', 'YYZ', 'SFO', 'HKO', 'ORD'].
Given the list of flights [('SFO', 'COM'), ('COM', 'YYZ')] and starting airport 'COM', you should return null.
Given the list of flights [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'A')] and starting airport 'A', you should return the list ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'] even though ['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'] is also a valid itinerary. However, the first one is lexicographically smaller.

Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:
Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.
You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (*) and a dead cell with a dot (.).

Given an array of strictly the characters 'R', 'G', and 'B', segregate the values of the array so that all the Rs come first, the Gs come second, and the Bs come last. You can only swap elements of the array.
Do this in linear time and in-place.

Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word. If there is more than one palindrome of minimum length that can be made, return the lexicographically earliest one (the first one alphabetically).
For example, given the string "race", you should return "ecarace", since we can add three letters to it (which is the smallest amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other palindromes that can be made from "race" by adding three letters, but "ecarace" comes first alphabetically.
As another example, given the string "google", you should return "elgoogle".

You are given an array of non-negative integers that represents a two-dimensional elevation map where each element is unit-width wall and the integer is the height. Suppose it will rain and all spots between two walls get filled up.
Compute how many units of water remain trapped on the map in O(N) time and O(1) space.
For example, given the input [2, 1, 2], we can hold 1 unit of water in the middle.
Given the input [3, 0, 1, 3, 0, 5], we can hold 3 units in the first index, 2 in the second, and 3 in the fourth index (we cannot hold 5 since it would run off to the left), so we can trap 8 units of water.

Run-length encoding is a fast and simple method of encoding strings. The basic idea is to represent repeated successive characters as a single count and character. For example, the string "AAAABBBCCDAA" would be encoded as "4A3B2C1D2A".
Implement run-length encoding and decoding. You can assume the string to be encoded have no digits and consists solely of alphabetic characters. You can assume the string to be decoded is valid.

Write an algorithm to justify text. Given a sequence of words and an integer line length k, return a list of strings which represents each line, fully justified.
More specifically, you should have as many words as possible in each line. There should be at least one space between each word. Pad extra spaces when necessary so that each line has exactly length k. Spaces should be distributed as equally as possible, with the extra spaces, if any, distributed starting from the left.
If you can only fit one word on a line, then you should pad the right-hand side with spaces.
Each word is guaranteed not to be longer than k.
For example, given the list of words ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"] and k = 16, you should return the following:
["the  quick brown", # 1 extra space on the left
"fox  jumps  over", # 2 extra spaces distributed evenly
"the   lazy   dog"] # 4 extra spaces distributed evenly

Implement regular expression matching with the following special characters:

- `.` (period) which matches any single character
- `*` (asterisk) which matches zero or more of the preceding element

That is, implement a function that takes in a string and a valid regular expression and returns whether or not the string matches the regular expression.
For example, given the regular expression "ra." and the string "ray", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "raymond" should return false.
Given the regular expression ".*at" and the string "chat", your function should return true. The same regular expression on the string "chats" should return false.

Implement locking in a binary tree. A binary tree node can be locked or unlocked only if all of its descendants or ancestors are not locked.
Design a binary tree node class with the following methods:
is_locked, which returns whether the node is locked
lock, which attempts to lock the node. If it cannot be locked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should lock it and return true.
unlock, which unlocks the node. If it cannot be unlocked, then it should return false. Otherwise, it should unlock it and return true.
You may augment the node to add parent pointers or any other property you would like. You may assume the class is used in a single-threaded program, so there is no need for actual locks or mutexes. Each method should run in O(h), where h is the height of the tree.

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.
This problem was asked by Google.
You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board. Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.
Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start. If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.
For example, given the following board:

```python
[[f, f, f, f],
[t, t, f, t],
[f, f, f, f],
[f, f, f, f]]
```

and start = `(3, 0)` (bottom left) and end = `(0, 0)` (top left), the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through `(1, 2)` because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.

For example, given the set of words 'quick', 'brown', 'the', 'fox', and the string "thequickbrownfox", you should return ['the', 'quick', 'brown', 'fox'].
Given the set of words 'bed', 'bath', 'bedbath', 'and', 'beyond', and the string "bedbathandbeyond", return either ['bed', 'bath', 'and', 'beyond] or ['bedbath', 'and', 'beyond'].

## How to Pick a Random Element from an Infinite Stream

Hope your interview practicing is going well! Let's work through the problem of uniformly picking a random element from a gigantic stream. This is a common interview question at companies like Google and Facebook.
Naively, we could process the stream and store all the elements we encounter in a list, find its size, and pick a random element from [0, size - 1]. The problem with this approach is that it would take O(N) space for a large N.
Instead, let's attempt to solve using loop invariants. On the ith iteration of our loop to pick a random element, let's assume we already picked an element uniformly from [0, i - 1]. In order to maintain the loop invariant, we would need to pick the ith element as the new random element at 1 / (i + 1) chance. For the base case where i = 0, let's say the random element is the first one. Then we know it works because
For i = 0, we would've picked uniformly from [0, 0].
For i > 0, before the loop began, any element K in [0, i - 1] had 1 / i chance of being chosen as the random element. We want K to have 1 / (i + 1) chance of being chosen after the iteration. This is the case since the chance of having being chosen already but not getting swapped with the ith element is 1 / i * (1 - (1 / (i + 1))) which is 1 / i * i / (i + 1) or 1 / (i + 1)
Let's see how the code would look:
import random

def pick(big_stream):
    random_element = None

    for i, e in enumerate(big_stream):
        if i == 0:
            random_element = e
        if random.randint(1, i + 1) == 1:
            random_element = e
    return random_element
Since we are only storing a single variable, this only takes up constant space!
Turns out this algorithm is called Reservoir Sampling. If you liked this problem and solution, sign up for our mailing list below for problems like these! You can also read our other post on how to solve tricky interview questions like this one here.

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given [(1, 3), (5, 8), (4, 10), (20, 25)], you should return [(1, 3), (4, 10), (20, 25)].

Given a mapping of digits to letters (as in a phone number), and a digit string, return all possible letters the number could represent. You can assume each valid number in the mapping is a single digit.

For example if {“2”: [“a”, “b”, “c”], 3: [“d”, “e”, “f”], …} then “23” should return [“ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf"].

This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:
{"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}
This means that 2 people exited the building. timestamp is in Unix time.

1 5 1
We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.
Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an algorithm used to generate all prime numbers smaller than N. The method is to take increasingly larger prime numbers, and mark their multiples as composite.
For example, to find all primes less than 100, we would first mark [4, 6, 8, ...] (multiples of two), then [6, 9, 12, ...] (multiples of three), and so on. Once we have done this for all primes less than N, the unmarked numbers that remain will be prime.
Implement this algorithm.
Bonus: Create a generator that produces primes indefinitely (that is, without taking N as an input).

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:
A researcher has index h if at least h of her N papers have h citations each. If there are multiple h satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.
For example, suppose N = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are [4, 3, 0, 1, 5]. Then the h-index would be 3, since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations.
Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as 0101 or 111110, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a 0 in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to 1.
Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
With this encoding, cats would be represented as 0000110111.
Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.
For example, the Euro sign, €, corresponds to the three bytes 11100010 10000010 10101100. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:
For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
For an n-byte character, the first byte starts with n ones and a zero. The other n - 1 bytes all start with 10.
Visually, this can be represented as follows.
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

A classroom consists of N students, whose friendships can be represented in an adjacency list. For example, the following descibes a situation where 0 is friends with 1 and 2, 3 is friends with 6, and so on.
{0: [1, 2],
 1: [0, 5],
 2: [0],
 3: [6],
 4: [],
 5: [1],
 6: [3]}
Each student can be placed in a friend group, which can be defined as the transitive closure of that student's friendship relations. In other words, this is the smallest set such that no student in the group has any friends outside this group. For the example above, the friend groups would be {0, 1, 2, 5}, {3, 6}, {4}.
Given a friendship list such as the one above, determine the number of friend groups in the class.

Given a set of points (x, y) on a 2D cartesian plane, find the two closest points.

For example, given the points `[(1, 1), (-1, -1), (3, 4), (6, 1), (-1, -6), (-4, -3)`], return `[(-1, -1), (1, 1)]`.

```python
def dist(a,b):

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words.

Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

* It can be found in the dictionary
* It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
* The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).
* Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```python
{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
```

and matrix:

```python
[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
```

Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other.

We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up to three children. Here is an example which represents the words code, cob, be, ax, war, and we.

```
       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \
x   b  e   r  e
```

The tree is structured according to the following rules:

* left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent prefix
* right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent prefix
* middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since code is the first word inserted in the tree, and cob lexicographically precedes cod, cob is represented as a left child extending from cod.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.

You are writing an AI for a 2D map game. You are somewhere in a 2D grid, and there are coins strewn about over the map.

Given the position of all the coins and your current position, find the closest coin to you in terms of Manhattan distance. That is, you can move around up, down, left, and right, but not diagonally. If there are multiple possible closest coins, return any of them.

For example, given the following map, where you are x, coins are o, and empty spaces are . (top left is 0, 0):

```
---------------------
| . | . | x | . | o |
---------------------
| o | . | . | . | . |
---------------------
| o | . | . | . | o |
---------------------
| . | . | o | . | . |

```

return (0, 4), since that coin is closest. This map would be represented in our question as:

Our position: (0, 2)
Coins: [(0, 4), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 2)]

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N` `order ids` in a log.

Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

* `record(order_id)`: adds the order_id to the log
* `get_last(i)`: gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

Circular buffer

```python

class LastOrders:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self._ptr = 0
        self._n = n
        self._buffer = [None] * n

    def record(self, order_id):
        self._buffer[self._ptr] = order_id
        self._ptr += 1
        self._ptr %= self._n

    def get_last(self, i):
        if i>self._n:
            raise ValueError()
        start = self._ptr - i
        if start < 0:
            return self._buffer[start % self._n :] + self._buffer[: self._ptr]
        return self._buffer[start: self._ptr]
```

What if we ask for more elements than what we put in ?

We will get some `None` in the list. We can always filter them out.

```
>>> l = LastOrders(10)
>>> l.record(1231231)
>>> l.get_last(1)
[1231231]
>>> l.get_last(2)
[None, 1231231]
>>> l.record(12311)
>>> l.get_last(2)
[1231231, 12311]
>>> l.get_last(3)
[None, 1231231, 12311]
